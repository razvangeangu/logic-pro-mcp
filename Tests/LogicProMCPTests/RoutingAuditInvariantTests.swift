/// MIDIKeyCommandsChannel.mappingTable ⇄ keycmd-only declared list** invariant.
///
/// v3.1.6 SETUP.md §4.1 shipped an incorrect "audited coverage matrix" that
/// listed only `transport.capture_recording` as effectively-keycmd-only. The
/// v3.7.x's effective list is the seven ops below plus nine orphans. The list
/// removes `nav.set_zoom_level` because `logic_navigate.set_zoom` now has an
/// Accessibility slider path.
///
/// `expectedKeycmdOnlyOps` is the single source of truth for:
/// - SETUP.md §4.1 "Effectively-keycmd-only" enumeration
/// - `MIDIKeyCommandsChannel.manualValidationDetailSuffix` health string
///
/// The invariants below catch the four most common drift modes:
/// 1. Op declared keycmd-only but cgEvent now has a shortcut for it (lift it out).
/// 2. Op declared keycmd-only but mappingTable doesn't actually carry it
///    (the keycmd path can't fire it either — broken declaration).
/// 3. Op declared keycmd-only but routingTable doesn't list midiKeyCommands
///    in its chain (router would never reach the keycmd channel).
/// 4. Health-detail string drifts from the declared set.
