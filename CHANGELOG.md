## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.2] — 2026-04-30

**Honest Contract closure on remaining MCU surfaces + lifecycle cache hygiene.** Post-v3.1.1 transverse audit (3 independent agents converged) surfaced four production-blocking gaps that v3.1.1's AX-side promotion did not reach: three MCU responders still emitted free-form strings instead of the 3-state envelope, `record_sequence` had a verification-window vs. poll-interval mismatch that false-failed every successful import, project lifecycle ops left a stale tracks list in the cache for up to a minute, and `ChannelRouter` would silently fall through a terminal AX `element_not_found` State C into a vacuous MCU success.

### P0 — fixed

- **MCU `track.set_mute` / `set_solo` / `set_arm` / `set_select` raw-string responses → State B `readback_unavailable`.** The MCU button surface is LED-only; Logic does not echo button state back through the MIDI stream that StateCache subscribes to. Wrapping in `HonestContract.encodeStateB` lets agents distinguish "press delivered, can't confirm" from "press confirmed" — the same contract every other MCU op already honors. Closes the last raw-string responders identified in the v3.1.1 release audit.
- **MCU `transport.play / stop / record / rewind / fast_forward / toggle_cycle` → State B `readback_unavailable`** for the same LED-only reason. AX-primary transport routing is unchanged; this only affects the MCU fallback path.
- **MCU `track.set_automation` → State B `readback_unavailable`.** Automation mode buttons (Read / Write / Touch / Latch / Trim) are LED-only writes too. AX-side automation-mode read-back is still backlogged (PRD §4.2 G).
- **`record_sequence` no longer false-fails on successful imports.** The verification window (2s) was strictly shorter than `ServerConfig.statePollingIntervalNs` (3s), so a healthy import's track-count delta never propagated to `cache.getTracks()` before the deadline — the dispatcher then declared "import may have failed silently" on every first call (witnessed live 3×). Verification now reads `AXLogicProElements.allTrackHeaders().count` directly (the same surface the AX import handler already validates against), removing the cache/poll race entirely.
- **`project.new / open / close` now invalidate the cache on success.** Previously the just-created/opened/closed project's tracks list lingered for up to one full poll cycle (3s minimum, observed >60s in practice), so resource reads and name-based routing decisions made against a phantom 38-track project that had been closed minutes ago. New `invalidateOnSuccess` helper calls `StateCache.clearProjectState()` only when the underlying channel reported success — failures leave the existing cache intact.

### P1 — fixed

- **`ChannelRouter` no longer falls through terminal State C envelopes.** When a primary channel returned `element_not_found`, `invalid_params`, or `not_implemented` (errors that no other channel can improve on), the router used to advance to the next channel in the chain — and on `track.select` / `set_instrument` against an out-of-range index that meant a press-only MCU button could fire on the wrong strip, masking the honest AX failure with a vacuous success. New `HonestContract.isTerminalStateC` helper inspects the State C envelope; matching errors short-circuit the fallback chain and preserve the original AX response. `ax_write_failed` and `permission_denied` are intentionally NOT terminal — those *can* be retried on a different channel.
- **`record_sequence` now enforces the 1024-note SMF-import upper bound** that `NoteSequenceParser`'s docstring already advertised (P1-4). Without the guard, a malformed (or adversarial) caller could hand `SMFWriter` an arbitrarily large event list — producing an oversize .mid file that slowed Logic's MIDI File Import dialog enough to appear hung. Returns an explicit `record_sequence: too many notes (N > 1024 max for SMF import)` error, immediately after the empty-events check and before any file-system or AX side-effects.
- **`track.delete` now refuses to proceed on State B (`verified:false`) selection** (P1-5). `track.select` can return State A (read-back confirmed selection landed on the requested track) or State B (write delivered but read-back inconclusive — `retry_exhausted`, `readback_mismatch`, etc.). Following State B with `track.delete` is a data-loss vector: whichever track was previously selected gets deleted instead of the requested target, with no UI signal that the operation hit the wrong row. `delete` now JSON-parses the select envelope and refuses unless `verified == true`, surfacing the original select response in the error detail so the caller can debug. `track.duplicate` keeps the prior `isSuccess`-only gate (no new behavior pending broader review of the duplicate path).

### P2 — fixed

- **`ServerConfig.statePollingIntervalNs` comment updated** from "2 s" to "3 s" to match the actual 3,000,000,000 ns value. Pure documentation drift.
- **`track.set_color` now returns an explicit State C `not_implemented` envelope** (P2-1) instead of the free-form `"Track color setting not supported via AX"` string. Callers (and the new router terminal-error gate) can now distinguish a structural "this surface does not exist" from a transient AX write failure. Logic Pro 12.0.1 does not expose track-color mutation through the Accessibility API — the color swatch in the inspector is a custom-drawn AppKit control with no AX children or settable attributes. `not_implemented` is also added to `HonestContract.FailureError` as a first-class enum case (the string was already in `terminalErrorCodes`).

### Verification

- **Build**: `swift build` clean.
- **Tests**: 824 → **862** passing (initial 8 P0/P1 regression tests + 4 follow-up tests for P1-4 / P1-5 / P2-1 in `TrackDispatcherDeleteTests` and `HonestContractOpTests`; pre-existing `testTrackDispatcherDeleteAndDuplicateRespectSelectionFlow` updated to use a verified-select envelope mock now that `delete` enforces State A; pre-existing AX-channel set_color expectation updated to match the new `not_implemented` envelope substring).
- **Live verification**: deferred to user-driven session — same discipline as v3.1.0 / v3.1.1 (`docs/HONEST-CONTRACT.md` §Live verification policy).

### Out-of-scope (deferred)

- AX-side automation-mode read-back (would promote `set_automation` to State A).
- V-Pot LED-ring CC 0x30..0x37 decoder for `mixer.set_pan` State A (PRD §4.2).
- `transport.pause` (no Logic op for it).

## [3.1.1] — 2026-04-26

**Honest Contract Extension.** v3.1.0 introduced the 3-state contract (State A confirmed / State B uncertain w/ reason / State C failed w/ error) for 4 ops. Guardian's v3.1.0 production-readiness review identified 22 mutating `.success("…")` ad-hoc shapes still in `AccessibilityChannel.swift` plus the `transport/state` resource lacking the cache envelope. v3.1.1 closes those gaps for the AX-channel ops; MCU-routed `track.set_automation` and the V-Pot pan State-A enabler are deferred to v3.1.2 (PRD §2.1 group F + G).

### Promoted to 3-state contract (v3.1.1)

| Op | Channel | Read-back source |
|----|---------|------------------|
| `track.rename` | AX | `AXValue` of name field after setAttribute |
| `track.set_mute` / `set_solo` / `set_arm` | AX | inline `AXValue` of toggle button (already retry-laddered) |
| `track.create_audio` / `create_instrument` / `create_drummer` / `create_external_midi` | AX | `allTrackHeaders.count` delta within 4×1s |
| `track.delete` | AX | `allTrackHeaders.count` decrement within 4×750ms |
| `transport.set_tempo` | AX | inline `AXValue` of tempo slider (≤1.0 BPM tolerance) |
| `transport.toggle_*` (legacy fallback) | AX | State B `readback_unavailable` (transport buttons are action triggers) |
| `transport.goto_position` (slider) | AX | `AXValue` of bar slider after setAttribute |
| `transport.goto_position` (dialog) | AppleScript | State B `readback_unavailable` (no playhead echo) |
| `region.move_to_playhead` | AppleScript | State B `readback_unavailable` (region position diff deferred) |
| `region.select_last` | AppleScript | State B `readback_unavailable` (AXSelected re-read deferred) |
| `midi.import_file` | AppleScript | track count delta + 500ms settle |
| `project.save_as` | AX dialog | `FileManager.fileExists` (already substantively honest; envelope only) |
| Mixer AC fallback (`defaultSetMixerValue`) | AX | inline slider `AXValue` (≤0.01 tolerance) — fixes v3.1.0 P1-A drift |

### Resource envelope unification

- `logic://transport/state` now carries `{cache_age_sec, fetched_at, data: {state, has_document}}` matching `tracks` / `library/inventory`. Legacy top-level `transport_age_sec` is replaced by `cache_age_sec`. **Breaking** for clients indexing the bare top-level `state` / `has_document` / `transport_age_sec` keys.

### Out-of-scope (deferred to v3.1.2+)

- `track.duplicate` (MIDIKeyCommands path, separate channel migration)
- `track.set_automation` (MCU button LED feedback, separate channel)
- `mixer.set_pan` State A (V-Pot LED-ring CC 0x30..0x37 decoder + `StateCache.panUpdatedAt` plumbing — PRD §4.2)
- `track.set_color` (no current AX implementation, separate feature)
- `transport.pause` (no Logic op)
- Region position pre/post diff via direct AX (not StateCache) read-back

### Verification

- **Build**: `swift build -c release` clean.
- **Tests**: 821 → **824** passing (3 new HC contract tests for `track.rename` and `track.set_mute` error envelopes).
- **Code review**: orchestrator-fallback BOOMER-6 (codex CLI hung twice, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` §2 fallback applied) identified 3 follow-up notes incorporated into PRD-v311 v0.2; strategist iter1 REVISE addressed in same.
- **Live verification**: deferred to user-driven session via `python3 /tmp/v310-live-verify.py` after MCP restart. No live cycles run automatically (per v3.0.9 CHANGELOG discipline, future live runs gated to Isaac's session).

### Known limitations

- 5 CGEvent residual call sites retained intentionally (rec-arm 5-step ladder fallback, productionMouseClick for Library Panel, sendReturnKey for new-track dialog). Documented as "intentional ladder fallback" — replacement requires AX-direct alternative search (v3.1.2 backlog).
- BOOMER-6+ via Codex CLI gpt-5.5 xhigh hung repeatedly on long prompts in this session — orchestrator-fallback critique applied per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` §2. Future runs should split critique into smaller prompts or use `model_reasoning_effort="medium"`.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-24

**Honest Contract.** Every mutating operation now returns one of three explicit states so that an LLM caller can distinguish *confirmed* writes from *unconfirmable* writes from *failed* writes without heuristically parsing free-form text. This closes the class of bug the Guardian v3.0.9 audit flagged as systemic: multiple ops returned `"success:true"` while the underlying AX write was never read back, so a mismatch between Logic's internal state and the reported state could silently propagate to callers. See [docs/HONEST-CONTRACT.md](docs/HONEST-CONTRACT.md) for the full wire contract and [docs/prd/PRD-v310-honest-contract.md](docs/prd/PRD-v310-honest-contract.md) for the motivation + design.

### Wire-level contract (new)

Every mutating op now returns one of:

```jsonc
// State A — confirmed
{"success": true, "verified": true,  "requested": "...", "observed": "..."}

// State B — uncertain (write landed, read-back couldn't confirm)
{"success": true, "verified": false, "reason": "echo_timeout_500ms" | "readback_unavailable" | "readback_mismatch" | "retry_exhausted", "requested": "...", "observed": null | "..."}

// State C — hard failure (write itself failed)
{"success": false, "error": "ax_write_failed" | "element_not_found" | "permission_denied" | "logic_not_running" | "invalid_params" | "readback_mismatch", "axCode": -25212, "hint": "..."}
```

Both enums (`reason`, `error`) are stable — callers can `switch` on them.

### Fixed

- **P0 — `track.set_instrument` now reads back the loaded patch.** `AccessibilityChannel.setTrackInstrument` (line 1766-1773 in v3.0.9) wrapped `selectPath`'s return code as success with zero post-write verification; `LibraryAccessor.selectCategory` threw away both `AXUIElementSetAttributeValue` and `AXUIElementPerformAction` return codes (`_ = …`), so a user whose Library Panel failed to advance a segment still received `"success":true` and a never-loaded patch. v3.1.0 threads AX error codes through `selectCategory` / `selectPreset` and then reads the actual selection off the Panel via `Inventory.currentPreset`; matches return State A, mismatches return State B `readback_mismatch`, hard AX failures return State C `ax_write_failed`.
- **P1 — `track.select` no longer returns "success but unverified".** `selectTrackViaAX` now reads `AXSelectedChildren` back with a 6× 100ms retry budget to absorb SMF-fresh-track lag, then returns State A on match, State B `readback_mismatch` when the read-back returns a different index, State B `retry_exhausted` when metadata never surfaces across the retry budget, or State C on AX write error. The bare `verified:false` success path from v3.0.9 is gone.
- **P1 — `mixer.set_volume` / `mixer.set_master_volume` now verify the MCU fader echo.** MCU pitch-bend writes to Logic were previously fire-and-forget; Logic's response (the 0xE0-stream fader position echo) was parsed into `StateCache` but nobody consulted it before reporting success. v3.1.0 adds `MCUChannel.pollFaderEcho` which polls `StateCache.channelStrips[strip].volume` at 25ms intervals for up to 500ms (override via `MCU_ECHO_TIMEOUT_MS=250|500|1000`). Match within ±2 LSB (14-bit MCU resolution, tolerance `2/16383`) → State A; timeout → State B `echo_timeout_500ms`. Each call now stamps its send time and requires the echo's write-timestamp to be strictly newer, so an identical-value re-send cannot be confirmed by a stale cache value from the prior call.
- **P1 — `mixer.set_pan` is now honestly uncertain.** V-Pot feedback is a relative CW/CCW nudge stream plus a CC LED-ring position, not the same event shape as the fader echo and not yet plumbed through to `StateCache`. v3.1.0 writes the V-Pot bytes and returns State B `readback_unavailable` — a forced honest answer rather than the prior silent claim of success.
- **P1 — `transport.set_cycle_range` AX path now includes `verified`.** The osascript fallback already returned `verified` but the AX primary path did not, producing schema drift between the two. v3.1.0 aligns both to the same 3-state shape.
- **P1 — `scan_library {mode:"disk"}` no longer poisons cross-op state.** The v3.0.6 cache split that separated `lastDiskScan` from `lastScan` is preserved, but v3.1.0 additionally tags resolved entries with `source` (`"panel"` | `"disk-only"` | `"both"`) and sets `loadable:false` for disk-only entries that the Panel taxonomy mapper can't route — so the downstream `track.set_instrument` caller never gets a green-light on a patch path that `selectPath` cannot actually navigate.
- **P2 — State resources now expose `cache_age_sec` + `fetched_at`.** `logic://tracks`, `logic://library/inventory`, `logic://mixer/strips`, and the other state resources wrap their payload in `{cache_age_sec, fetched_at (ISO8601), data}`. A caller that needs freshness can now assert on age instead of guessing.

### Added

- `Sources/LogicProMCP/Utilities/HonestContract.swift` — single source of truth for 3-state JSON encoding (`encodeStateA` / `encodeStateB` / `encodeStateC`) + the two stable-rawValue enums (`UncertainReason`, `FailureError`). All new mutating ops go through this module.
- `docs/HONEST-CONTRACT.md` — client-facing guide to the 3-state contract, recommended retry patterns, and the "what not to do" list for server contributors.
- `docs/prd/PRD-v310-honest-contract.md` — PRD recording the design + risk analysis that drove this release.
- `MCU_ECHO_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable — 250 / 500 / 1000ms override for the MCU fader echo poll window. Useful for slow projects / slow Logic builds where the default 500ms is too tight.
- New test suites: `HonestContractTests.swift`, `HonestContractOpTests.swift`, `MCUChannelEchoTests.swift`, `ResourceCacheAgeTests.swift`, `ScanLibraryCacheSplitTests.swift` — 24 new test cases covering all three states per op + the cache-split + the resource `cache_age_sec` field.

### Changed

- `README.md` §Status withdrawn the "every patch on disk is addressable via `track.set_instrument`" wording. The factual reality is more nuanced: the disk→Panel taxonomy mapper routes a large majority of disk patches to a Panel-navigable path, but the unmapped tail (currently `z_Legacy/World/*`, some exotic legacy Orchestral variants) is dropped by the mapper and therefore not loadable via AX — the honest answer is now reflected in the scan output (`source:"disk-only"`, `loadable:false`) and documented in the status section.
- Test suite total: 790 → **821** (31 new tests, all passing, no skips changed). Includes Ralph-2 regression guards for MCU stale-cache false-positives (testSetVolumeStaleCacheDoesNotReturnStateA / testSetMasterVolumeStaleCacheDoesNotReturnStateA) and the `mode:both` → panel-loadable resolve_path regression (testResolvePathAfterBothScanReturnsPanelLoadableForPanelPaths).
- `track.select` State B taxonomy refined (Ralph-2 / P2-2): a read-back that returns a different index now reports `reason:"readback_mismatch"` instead of `reason:"retry_exhausted"`. `retry_exhausted` is now reserved for `selectionMetadataUnavailable` (read-back metadata never surfaces across the retry budget). Clients switching on `reason` can now distinguish accept-and-diverge (mismatch) from back-off-and-refetch (exhausted).
- `scan_library {mode:"both"}` now seeds `lastPanelScan` from its inline AX scan so subsequent `resolve_path` queries correctly classify Panel-loadable paths with `loadable:true` (Ralph-2 / C3). Previously these were misreported as `loadable:false`.
- `track.set_instrument` / `transport.set_cycle_range` State C responses now route through `.error(...)` so the MCP envelope's `isError:true` is set, matching `track.select`'s State C shape (Ralph-2 / M-1).

### Compatibility

- **Mutating tool responses — additive.** v3.0.9 clients that don't read `verified` / `reason` fields still parse v3.1.0 mutating-op responses correctly. The legacy `success` field remains the first-line signal and has the same true/false meaning for hard failures. Clients that *do* want the confirmation signal should start reading `verified`; `verified:true` is the strict "I saw Logic accept this" claim and `verified:false` is the explicit "I sent it but can't confirm" claim the server previously couldn't distinguish.
- **BREAKING — resource envelope schema.** Two read-only resources now wrap their payload in a new top-level object so the `cache_age_sec` + `fetched_at` honesty metadata can be attached without polluting the payload shape. v3.0.9 clients that indexed into the bare payload must migrate to read the new `.data` / `.root` fields.

  | Resource / tool | v3.0.9 payload | v3.1.0 payload |
  |-----------------|----------------|----------------|
  | `logic://tracks` | `[{ "id": 0, ... }, ...]` | `{ "cache_age_sec": 12, "fetched_at": "...", "data": [{ "id": 0, ... }, ...] }` |
  | `logic://library/inventory` | `{ "categories": [...], "root": {...}, ... }` | `{ "cache_age_sec": 3600, "fetched_at": "...", "data": <legacy object> }` |
  | `logic_tracks.scan_library` result | `{ "categories": [...], "root": {...}, ... }` | `{ "source": "panel"\|"disk"\|"both", "root": <legacy object> }` |

  **Migration**: clients should read `.data` (state resources) or `.root` (scan_library) to reach the legacy shape. Example:

  ```diff
  - const tracks = await readResource("logic://tracks");
  - const firstTrackId = tracks[0].id;
  + const envelope = await readResource("logic://tracks");
  + const firstTrackId = envelope.data[0].id;
  ```

  Previous CHANGELOG wording ("additive, not breaking") was inaccurate and is corrected here; the envelope wrap is a genuine breaking change at the resource layer even though mutating-op responses remain additive. See `docs/HONEST-CONTRACT.md §State resource` for the full contract.

### Verification

- **Build**: `swift build` clean on macOS 15 / Apple Silicon.
- **Tests**: 821 / 821 passing (same skip list as v3.0.9: 2 timer-driven lifecycle tests).
- **Live Logic Pro**: (to be filled in during T10 release step — v3.1.0 does not ship before 3+ live verification cycles across `set_instrument`, `track.select`, `mixer.set_volume`, `set_cycle_range`).

### Known limitations

- `mixer.set_pan` returns `verified:false` on every call until the V-Pot → StateCache plumbing lands (tracked as a follow-up). The operation still sends the correct bytes; only the verification signal is degraded.
- The MCU fader echo poll relies on Logic's Mackie Control Universal feedback being active. In a fresh project where the MCU control surface isn't registered yet, `mixer.set_volume` will always fall through to State B `echo_timeout_500ms` — this is the correct honest answer (the bytes went out, Logic didn't echo) but callers need to complete the MCU setup from `docs/SETUP.md` before the `verified:true` path is reachable.

## [3.0.9] — 2026-04-23

**`track.select` actually moves Logic's track selection now.** The bug that v3.0.8 called out as "known limitation" — and that silently propagated through v3.0.3 → v3.0.7 — is fixed, live-verified end-to-end on Logic Pro 12.0.1 (Apple Silicon, macOS 15+, KR locale). Every prior release from v3.0.5 onward was reviewed only at the unit-test level; v3.0.8 was "first release verified by live Logic Pro playback" but its verification scope was `record_sequence`, not `track.select`. This release pays down the missing live verification for the selection primitive that every instrument / mix / arm op depends on.

An honest apology: v3.0.5, v3.0.6, v3.0.7, and v3.0.8 all shipped without a live `track.select` round-trip. The test doubles were passing, the release checklist was green, and the bug — `selectTrackViaAX` returning `true` while AX selection stayed on track 0 — was hiding behind a macOS AX quirk that only surfaces against the real Logic Pro UI.

### Root cause

`AXLogicProElements.selectTrackViaAX` step 1 (`AXHelpers.performAction(header, kAXPressAction)`) was returning `true` vacuously. On Logic Pro 12, the track-header row is an `AXLayoutItem` whose only declared AX action is `AXShowMenu`. `AXUIElementPerformAction(element, kAXPressAction)` nevertheless returns `kAXErrorSuccess` (rawValue 0) on that element — macOS AX does NOT reject an unsupported action for `AXLayoutItem`-role children of a writable-selection parent. The Swift wrapper translated that to `true`, so the ladder exited early on step 1 *without changing selection*. Every subsequent op (`set_instrument`, `mute`, `solo`, `arm`) then operated on whatever track had actually been selected — usually track 0 — regardless of the `index` parameter passed.

The 15-second wait Isaac tested after `record_sequence` did nothing because the bug was never timing-dependent. It was a false-positive success from a well-formed AX action that Logic silently ignored.

Live-reproduced on v3.0.8 (10-track project, initial selection index 0):

```
track.select { index: 1 } → response "{\"selected\":1,\"verified\":false}"
<read tracks resource>
→ track 0 isSelected=true; every other track isSelected=false
```

Note the `"verified":false` — the `verifyTrackSelection` read-back was correctly reporting that selection never landed, but the tool response still said "selected" instead of surfacing the mismatch as an error.

### The fix

Logic Pro 12's track-header rail is exposed as an `AXGroup` with description `"트랙 헤더"` / `"Tracks header"`. That group has a writable `AXSelectedChildren` attribute. Setting `AXSelectedChildren` on the parent group to `[targetLayoutItem]` — the exact same pattern that already worked for Library preset selection (shipped in v3.0.3) — atomically moves Logic's project-wide track selection, deselects every other track, updates the Inspector, and rebinds the Library Panel.

```swift
AXUIElementSetAttributeValue(
    headersGroup,                                // AXGroup desc="트랙 헤더"
    kAXSelectedChildrenAttribute as CFString,
    [headerRow] as CFArray                       // target AXLayoutItem
)
```

`selectTrackViaAX` is rewritten to try this as step 1. The prior four steps (`AXPress`, `AXSelected=true`, child `AXPress`, coord-click) are kept as fallbacks for test doubles and hypothetical Logic build drift.

### Changed

- **`AXLogicProElements.selectTrackViaAX(at:)`** — primary strategy is now `SetAttr(kAXSelectedChildrenAttribute, [headerRow])` on the parent headers group. The four prior AX strategies (AXPress on header, AXSelected=true, child AXPress, coord-click) drop to fallback positions for test-double compatibility and extreme Logic build drift.

### Verification (live, 3 cycles × 10 tracks each)

All 30 live `track.select` calls passed end-to-end:

```
Cycle 1/2/3 each:
  select(0) → tracks[0].isSelected=True, others=False  PASS
  select(1) → tracks[1].isSelected=True, others=False  PASS
  ...
  select(9) → tracks[9].isSelected=True, others=False  PASS
```

End-to-end `set_instrument` verified live:

```
Before: track[3].name = "Studio Grand"
track.select { index: 3 } → {"selected":3,"verified":true}
track.set_instrument { index: 3, path: "Bass/Simple Foundation" }
  → {"category":"Bass","path":"Bass/Simple Foundation","preset":"Simple Foundation"}
After: track[3].name = "Simple Foundation"   ← changed to correct preset
```

Screenshots captured at `/tmp/v309-tools/cycle1-final.png` and `/tmp/v309-tools/set-instrument-test.png` show the Inspector binding to the selected track and the Library Panel highlighting the loaded preset.

Unit suite: 792 tests passing, no regressions.

### Deprecations

None.

### Upgrade notes

- Callers that had been working around the v3.0.3–v3.0.8 bug by manually clicking tracks in Logic's UI before calling `set_instrument` no longer need to. `track.select` followed by any track-scoped op now operates on the requested index.
- The `tracks` resource (`logic://tracks`) reflects fresh selection state within one StatePoller cycle (≤3 s). Within a single tool-call chain, the AX layer is authoritative regardless of cache freshness, so `track.select` → `track.set_instrument` in rapid succession works correctly even when the resource read would still show the old selection.

## [3.0.8] — 2026-04-23

**First release verified by live Logic Pro playback.** v3.0.5, v3.0.6, and v3.0.7 all passed their unit-test suites and were reviewed at the unit-test level only — none of them were exercised against a running Logic Pro instance with a fresh project and a real `record_sequence` call. That gap is on us. Isaac reproduced the resulting production bug on v3.0.7: `record_sequence` with `instrument_path: "Electronic Drums/Brooklyn Borough"` returned `"instrument":"loaded:Electronic Drums/Brooklyn Borough"` while the new track silently stayed on Logic's default Software Instrument (Studio Grand piano). The response was a lie; every prior review missed it.

v3.0.8 investigates the root cause with live AX probing, removes the unsafe internal auto-load entirely (per Isaac's explicit directive — *"If in doubt, decouple — Isaac is tired of false promises"*), and documents a deeper `set_instrument` selection bug that surfaced during live testing.

### Root cause

Two compounding bugs, both only visible with a running Logic Pro:

1. **`LibraryAccessor.selectPath` reports false success.** `selectCategory` unconditionally returns `true` once the AXStaticText element is found, regardless of whether the `AXUIElementSetAttributeValue` / `AXUIElementPerformAction` writes committed (both `_ = …`, discarded). `selectPreset` returns `pressResult == .success` — which only confirms the AX action was *delivered*, not that Logic's handler swapped the channel-strip instrument. So `set_instrument.isSuccess` became a guaranteed-true signal that the v3.0.2 auto-load path happily propagated to the user.
2. **`AXLogicProElements.selectTrackViaAX(at:)` silently fails on fresh SMF-created tracks.** All four strategies (AXPress on the header, AXSelected=true, child AXPress, coord-click fallback) are dispatched but NONE change selection on the first run-loop tick after SMF import — even though the header is in the AX tree and `findTrackHeader(at:)` resolves it. Selection stays on the previously-selected track. The subsequent `selectPath` then loads the preset onto whichever track was already selected; on a project with pre-existing content the auto-load could replace the wrong track's patch silently.

Live reproduction on v3.0.7 (fresh project with one pre-existing `Deluxe Classic` Electric Piano track; binary run against Logic Pro 12 over stdio):

```
record_sequence { notes: "...", instrument_path: "Electronic Drums/Brooklyn Borough" }
 → response "instrument":"skipped"
 → new MIDI track created, name="Studio Grand" (piano icon), no drum kit
```

Live reproduction of the second failure mode on a v3.0.8-draft (which still attempted the auto-load):

```
record_sequence { ... instrument_path: "Electronic Drums/Brooklyn Borough" }
 → new track 1 created (name="Studio Grand", unchanged)
 → pre-existing track 0 name changed to "Brooklyn Borough" (drum kit icon)
 → Library Panel's preset load landed on the wrong track: track 0 was
   corrupted, track 1 was untouched.
```

That observation is what drove the v3.0.8 decision to stop attempting the auto-load entirely.

### Changed

- **`TrackDispatcher.handleRecordSequenceSMF` — internal instrument auto-load REMOVED.** The dispatcher no longer routes `track.select` or `track.set_instrument` from inside `record_sequence`. The response always carries `"instrument":"not-attempted"` (or `"instrument":"ignored:<path>"` when the legacy `instrument_path` param is sent — retained for wire compatibility only). Callers that want a specific patch must follow up with an explicit `set_instrument` call AFTER ensuring the intended track is selected. See the known limitation below.
- **Default `"Synthesizer/Bass"` fallback removed.** Prior versions silently loaded Synth Bass on every caller that omitted `instrument_path`; v3.0.8 does nothing by default so no caller is surprised by an uninvited instrument change.
- **`logic_tracks.record_sequence` tool description + `logic_system.help`** updated: the `instrument_path` param is removed from the schema comment, and the `"instrument"` response value is documented as always `"not-attempted"` or `"ignored:<legacy path>"`.

### Added

- **`TrackDispatcher.escapeJSONString(_:)`** — the response JSON now embeds the `instrumentStatus` field with proper escaping. Forwarded messages can legitimately contain quotes / newlines / control chars; pre-3.0.8 code interpolated them directly, which could have produced malformed JSON in rare error paths.

### Known limitation

`track.set_instrument { index: N }` still loads the preset onto the currently-selected track rather than the track at index `N` when `N`'s header is in a state where `selectTrackViaAX` cannot change selection (brand-new tracks on the first run-loop tick after SMF import; observed in live testing on Logic Pro 12 over Apple Silicon). Callers should manually click the intended track header (or wait several seconds after track creation before calling `set_instrument`) until this is fixed in a follow-up release. A future fix will likely need to replace the AXPress-based selection with a keystroke-based navigation or a different AX primitive that Logic's track-header handler accepts on fresh tracks.

### Verification

- **v3.0.7 bug reproduced live** (fresh untitled project, one pre-existing `Deluxe Classic` track, fresh LogicProMCP spawned via stdio): `record_sequence { instrument_path: "Electronic Drums/Brooklyn Borough" }` → response `"instrument":"skipped"`, new track named `"Studio Grand"`. Screenshot captured at `/tmp/v308-verify/cycle1-after.png` during investigation.
- **v3.0.8 behavior verified live** (same fresh-project setup): `record_sequence` without `instrument_path` → response `"instrument":"not-attempted"`, new track named `"Studio Grand"` (Logic's default SI), pre-existing track untouched. No silent corruption. `record_sequence { instrument_path: "X" }` → response `"instrument":"ignored:X (v3.0.8: internal auto-load removed …)"`, behavior identical (no write side effects).
- Full unit-test regression: 790 tests passing (same skip list as v3.0.5/6/7). Version-consistency test updated to lock v3.0.8 across `ServerConfig`, `manifest.json`, `Formula/logic-pro-mcp.rb`, and `Scripts/install.sh`.

### Apology

v3.0.5, v3.0.6, and v3.0.7 shipped with no live Logic Pro verification. Isaac paid for three bad releases to catch a bug that reproduces on the first user-facing call. v3.0.8 is the first release where the investigation and fix were done *against a running Logic Pro project* end-to-end. Future `record_sequence` / Library Panel changes must include a live-verification log in the PR body before the Formula SHA is bumped — unit tests alone are not sufficient for this surface area.

## [3.0.7] — 2026-04-23

Hotfix: `scan_library` dispatcher dropped the `mode` param on the floor.

### Fixed

- **`TrackDispatcher.swift:249` scan_library forwards `mode` param.** v3.0.6 added mode routing (`ax`|`disk`|`both`) in `AccessibilityChannel.library.scan_all` handler, but the track dispatcher called `router.route(operation: "library.scan_all")` with no params — so `{mode: "disk"}` from MCP clients never reached the handler and always fell back to default AX. Now forwards the mode string when provided. Tool description updated to document the mode parameter. New regression test `testTrackDispatcherScanLibraryForwardsModeParam` locks the forward path for disk/both/default.

## [3.0.6] — 2026-04-21

Guardian round-1 (v3.0.5) blocker follow-up. v3.0.5 shipped the disk scan but three P0 regressions surfaced in review: (1) emitted disk paths did not match the Library Panel's flattened taxonomy, so `selectPath` failed at segment 0 on the majority of patches; (2) the default `mode` silently flipped from AX to disk, poisoning the actor's `lastScan` cache (and therefore every `resolve_path` / `set_instrument` follow-up) with Panel-invalid paths; (3) the on-disk `library-inventory.json` canonical file was silently overwritten with the disk-shape inventory with no version tag, so downstream consumers had no way to detect the format shift. v3.0.6 fixes all three: adds a disk→Panel taxonomy mapper, reverts the default mode to `ax`, and tags + separates the inventory files by source.

### Added

- **`LibraryDiskScanner.mapDiskPathToPanel([String]) -> [String]?`** — pure longest-prefix mapper that rewrites disk segments into Panel segments. Flattens the three `Drums & Percussion/*` sub-folders and all five `Keyboard/*` sub-folders into Panel top-level categories (`Acoustic Drums`, `Electronic Drums`, `Percussion`, `Acoustic Piano`, `Clavinet`, `Electric Piano`, `Mellotron`, `Organ`). Maps `z_Legacy/Orchestral` and `Strings` to the Panel's `Orchestral`. Renames intermediate disk folders (currently `z01 Kit Pieces` → `Kit Pieces`). Returns `nil` for unmapped paths (e.g. `z_Legacy/World/...`) so the scanner can drop patches that have no Panel route. Cross-referenced against the committed v3.0.4 AX Panel inventory.
- **`AccessibilityChannel.ScanMode` / `parseScanMode(_:) -> ScanMode`** — pure, testable dispatch for the `library.scan_all` `mode` parameter. Unknown values, empty strings, and nil all return `.ax` (not `.disk`) so a v3.0.5-style silent default flip cannot recur.
- **`library-inventory-disk.json`** — dedicated output file for disk-sourced inventories. Disk scans no longer overwrite `library-inventory.json` (which remains the AX-canonical snapshot).
- **`source` field on written inventory JSON** — every persisted inventory now carries a top-level `"source": "ax" | "disk"` marker. Downstream consumers that need to branch on scan-shape can do so without inspecting paths.
- **Depth cap (12) + symlink visited-set** in `LibraryDiskScanner` — mirrors `LibraryAccessor.enumerateTree`; a symlink cycle can no longer drive runaway recursion.
- **1 MiB size warning** — `writeInventoryJSON` logs a `Log.warn` when the encoded inventory exceeds 1 MiB so a future pagination decision is signalled, not silent.
- **`Tests/LogicProMCPTests/ScanLibraryModeRoutingTests.swift`** — locks down the mode dispatch: default / empty / explicit / mixed-case / unknown / regression-against-v3.0.5.
- **`LibraryDiskScanner` unit tests for every mapping case** — one test per `diskToPanel` entry, identity-passthrough for `Bass`/`Guitar`/`Mallet`/`Synthesizer`, unmapped-drops, `z01` rename, empty input, symlink cycle. Plus an integration assertion that every category emitted by a real-machine scan exists in the v3.0.4 Panel snapshot's `categories` array.

### Changed

- **`library.scan_all` default reverted from `disk` to `ax`** — v3.0.5 users who explicitly passed `{"mode": "disk"}` are unaffected. Callers that did not pass a mode get the v3.0.4 AX behavior (legacy, Panel-authoritative but undercounting) back. Use `{"mode": "disk"}` to opt in to the Panel-taxonomy-mapped disk scan, `{"mode": "both"}` for the diff summary.
- **`LibraryDiskScanner.scan()` output** — every emitted path is now Panel-navigable. Top-level `root.children` names match the Panel's 13 categories (subset of), not the disk's 7 folders. Existing v3.0.5 tests have been updated to reflect the Panel-rooted contract.

### Fixed

- **P0-1 — taxonomy mismatch** — disk scan no longer emits `selectPath`-invalid paths. A disk-shape path like `Drums & Percussion/Electronic Drums/Roland TR-909.patch` now surfaces as the Panel path `Electronic Drums/Roland TR-909`, which is what the Library Panel's column-1 list actually contains.
- **P0-2 — silent default-mode flip** — `lastScan` is no longer written in disk-shape for callers that did not request it. `resolve_path` and `set_instrument` for no-mode callers behave identically to v3.0.4.
- **P0-3 — inventory JSON overwrite + missing source tag** — disk scans write to `library-inventory-disk.json`, not the canonical AX file. Both files now carry `"source"`.

### Testing

- `LibraryDiskScannerTests`: 30 tests (was 8) — 15 new mapper/scan unit cases, Panel-inventory cross-check integration, symlink-cycle guard.
- `ScanLibraryModeRoutingTests`: 8 new tests — the complete mode-routing matrix + v3.0.5 regression guard.
- Full suite: 789 tests pass (skips: `testLogicProServerStartCoversDefaultPortAndPollerLifecyclePaths`, `testStatePollerStartStopLifecycle`).

## [3.0.5] — 2026-04-23

Filesystem-backed library enumeration. v3.0.4's `scan_library` still returned only 345 leaves (7% of the on-disk reality) because its live AX probe was deliberately bounded: clicking a preset-looking element in Logic's Library Panel *loads* that preset onto the focused track, and the probe had no non-destructive folder-vs-leaf discriminator for column 2+. v3.0.5 side-steps the problem entirely — instead of probing the Library Panel it enumerates `~/Music/Logic Pro Library.bundle/Patches/Instrument/` on disk, where every `.patch` is a directory and the filesystem hierarchy is exactly the path Logic's Library Panel navigates. On a full factory install this surfaces 5,000+ leaves (vs the prior 345) with no AX interaction, no panel mutation, and no dependency on whether the Library is even open. Paired with v3.0.4's N-segment `selectPath`, every patch on disk is now both enumerable AND loadable.

### Added

- **`LibraryDiskScanner.scan(homeDirectory:fileManager:)` / `scan(bundleURL:fileManager:start:)`** — pure filesystem enumerator. Recursively walks the Patches/Instrument bundle, emits a `LibraryRoot` schema-identical to the AX scan (same fields, same `LibraryNode` recursive shape, same `presetsByCategory` flat index). Strips `.patch` from display names so clients see "Acid Etched Bass", not "Acid Etched Bass.patch" — matching the Library Panel display and the segment format required by `selectPath`. Skips dotfiles, tolerates unreadable subfolders (graceful-empty folder node), and throws `ScanError.bundleNotFound` only if the top-level bundle is missing.
- **`library.scan_all` mode parameter** — `{"mode": "disk"}` (new default), `{"mode": "ax"}` (legacy AX probe, unchanged), `{"mode": "both"}` (runs both and returns a diff summary with leaf/node counts and on-disk-only count). Unknown mode values fall through to `"disk"` so older clients cannot accidentally enable the legacy path by sending a stale param.

### Changed

- **`library.scan_all` default behavior** — previously only ran the AX probe (345 leaves on a full factory install). Now defaults to the disk scan. Clients that relied on the legacy 345-leaf output can opt in with `{"mode": "ax"}`, but the JSON schema is unchanged so most callers transparently get the wider coverage.
- **`library.resolve_path`** — now resolves against whichever tree was most recently produced (disk or AX), via the same `lastScan` actor state. Deep paths like `Synthesizer/Bass/Acid Etched Bass` now resolve after a disk scan; before v3.0.5 they returned "not found" because the 2-level AX scan never surfaced them.

### Fixed

- **14× `scan_library` undercount** — closes the v3.0.4 known limitation. 345 leaves → 5,000+ leaves on a full factory install; no AX mutation of the user's project.

### Testing

- New: `LibraryDiskScannerTests` — 8 tests covering happy path, leaf suffix stripping, `presetsByCategory` flattening, hidden-file skip, missing-bundle throw, empty-bundle graceful-empty, 4-level hierarchies, and a local-machine integration smoke test (only runs if the factory bundle is present, expects ≥1000 leaves).
- Full regression: 759 tests passing under `swift test --skip testLogicProServerStartCoversDefaultPortAndPollerLifecyclePaths --skip testStatePollerStartStopLifecycle`.

## [3.0.4] — 2026-04-21

N-column Library Panel navigation. Pre-3.0.4 `track.set_instrument` took `parts[0]` + `parts[last]` of the supplied path and dropped every middle segment, so a live call with `Synthesizer/Bass/Acid Etched Bass` would call `selectCategory("Synthesizer")` then `selectPreset("Acid Etched Bass")` — but by that point column 2 held Synthesizer's 14 *subfolders* (Arpeggiated, Bass, Lead, Pad, …), not its presets, so the second call always failed with "Preset not found". The fix walks every segment in order through a single AX primitive (`AXSelectedChildren` + `AXPress`), which is what Logic's 2-column sliding Library Panel actually needs: clicking a subfolder in column 2 slides the view so column 1 becomes the subfolder and column 2 shows its direct children, and clicking a leaf preset commits it without sliding.

### Added

- **`LibraryAccessor.selectPath(segments:settleDelay:runtime:library:)`** — N-segment walker for the Library Panel. Clicks each segment via the existing AX-native selection pair (`AXSelectedChildren` on the parent `AXList` + `AXPress` on the target `AXStaticText`), waiting for Logic's column-slide to settle between clicks. 2-segment calls behave identically to the previous `setInstrument(category:preset:)` path; 3+ segment calls unlock the deeper subfolders that Logic exposes (top-level Synthesizer, Electronic Drums, etc.).

### Changed

- **`track.set_instrument`** delegates to `LibraryAccessor.selectPath` instead of the hardcoded `selectCategory + selectPreset` pair. Paths with 2 segments (`Bass/Sub Bass`) keep working exactly as before; paths with 3+ segments now resolve correctly. Error message updated to reference the new N-segment contract: "Invalid 'path': must have at least 2 segments (e.g. 'Bass/Sub Bass' or 'Synthesizer/Bass/Acid Etched Bass')".

### Not changed (and why)

- **`scan_library` deep walk** — `buildLiveTreeProbe` still returns `[]` at depth 2+. The algorithm in `enumerateTree` already supports arbitrary depth (proven by `testEnumerateTree_Deep6Level` and the new `testEnumerateTree_3Level_SynthBass_ElectronicDrums`), but the production probe cannot safely descend by "click and observe": clicking a preset-leaf in Logic's Library actually *loads* it onto the focused track, which would mutate the user's project during an enumeration scan. A non-destructive deep scan requires a folder-vs-leaf discriminator read from the AX tree *before* clicking (the disclosure-triangle indicator Isaac observed in column 2). Implementing that safely needs a dedicated offline probe session against Logic's AX exposure, which is deferred to a follow-up release. For now `scan_library` continues to return the flat 2-level view (top-level categories + direct presets, ~345 leaves) — the undercount is honest: the tool reports only what it can read without side effects. Users who know a deeper path can still call `track.set_instrument` with the full path; only the bulk enumeration path is limited.

### Testing

- New: `testSelectByPath_ThreeSegment_Synthesizer_Bass_AcidEtchedBass` (locks Isaac's exact live-bug path at the selectByPath layer)
- New: `testSelectByPath_FourSegment_DeepPath` (confirms arbitrary depth)
- New: `testSelectByPath_ThreeSegment_MissingMiddle_Aborts` (fail-fast on missing intermediate)
- New: `testEnumerateTree_3Level_SynthBass_ElectronicDrums` (locks the 4-leaf expectation for the 3-level fake tree)
- Full regression: `swift test --skip testLogicProServerStartCoversDefaultPortAndPollerLifecyclePaths --skip testStatePollerStartStopLifecycle` passes.

## [3.0.3] — 2026-04-20

AX-native control surface pass. Isaac's directive was blunt — *"GUI 단순 클릭 이벤트로 컨트롤하는 부분 모두 100% Apple 공식 AX 혹은 다른 방법으로"*: replace every primary GUI-click call path with the Apple AX API. v3.0.3 audits and rewrites the remaining live click sites so that AX attempts always run first, and CGEvent synthesis only survives as a last-resort fallback where Logic's own UX contract requires it.

### Changed

- **Track selection (`track.set_instrument` + `track.select`) is now AX-native.** Replaced the ~45-line CGEvent coord-click block in `AccessibilityChannel.defaultSelectTrack` / `setTrackInstrument` with a new `AXLogicProElements.selectTrackViaAX(at:)` ladder:
  1. `AXPress` on the track header.
  2. `AXSelected = true` attribute write (if the attribute is settable).
  3. `AXPress` on each child element (name field, icon, etc.) — some Logic header subviews reach the selection handler only through children.
  4. CGEvent coord-click (last resort, only if all 3 AX steps reported failure).

  Caller (`AccessibilityChannel`) still owns the read-back verification via `verifyTrackSelection` — the helper just returns whether any ladder step claimed success. The first three steps cover 100% of production Logic Pro 12.0.1 headers observed in E2E; step 4 remains because AX tree-mutation lag under heavy region loads can cause the first three to silently no-op in rare cases.

- **Plugin Setting popup (`plugin.scan_presets`) prefers `AXShowMenu` + `AXPress` before CGEvent.** Previously the handler always CGEvent-clicked the Setting popup at its AX-computed centre; the T0 v0.6 note said "popup AXPress unreliable" without having tested `AXShowMenu`, which is NSAccessibility's canonical action for opening a popup button's menu programmatically. v3.0.3 tries `kAXShowMenuAction` first, falls back to `kAXPressAction`, and only CGEvent-clicks if neither produces an AXMenu within a 350 ms settle window.

### Rationale: what was *not* replaced, and why

- **Rec-arm / mute / solo checkboxes (`track.set_mute` / `track.set_solo` / `track.record_arm`)** — already an AX-first ladder: `AXPress` → `AXConfirm` → `AXValue = NSNumber` → `AXValue = CFBoolean` → CGEvent click (with read-back verification between each step). The mouse-click step is reached only if *all four* AX attempts silently fail, which is the documented behaviour for certain Logic 12 custom checkbox subviews. Removing this last step would regress production reliability with no gain.

- **`transport.set_tempo` tempo slider double-click** — Logic Pro 12 exposes the tempo as an `AXSlider` whose own help text says "double-click to enter a new value". AX `AXValue` assignment only nudges by ±1 BPM; `AXIncrement` only jumps by +10. The double-click opens an inline numeric entry that is Logic's *documented* UX for exact-value entry. v3.0.3 keeps the CGEvent double-click + keystroke path behind the AX-verified slider discovery; this is AX-native tempo control wrapped around a Logic-mandated UX primitive, not a "simple click control" substitute. The AX-only path (direct `AXValue` set) is still used for the fake-AX test harness where no mouse subsystem exists.

### Testing

- Full regression: `swift test --skip testLogicProServerStartCoversDefaultPortAndPollerLifecyclePaths --skip testStatePollerStartStopLifecycle` — 747 tests pass.
- New unit coverage: `testAccessibilityChannelAXBackedTrackDefaultsUseFakeAXTree` + `testAccessibilityChannelAXBackedTrackSelectFailsWhenVerifiedSelectionSettlesElsewhere` now exercise the AX-first path end-to-end (previously these tests expected the CGEvent coord-click path which is now only reached after 3 AX attempts).

## [3.0.2] — 2026-04-20

Live-use hotfix targeting two E2E pain points found while actually generating music in Logic Pro 12.0.1 at the v3.0.1 MCP surface.

### Fixed

- **`transport.set_tempo` now works end-to-end without manual intervention.** Logic Pro 12 exposes the control-bar tempo as an **AXSlider** (role "AXSlider", description "템포" / "Tempo") — not a text field. Direct AXValue assignment only nudges by +1 and AXIncrement jumps by +10, so neither gives an exact value. The slider's help text reveals the real path: **double-click opens an inline numeric entry**. v3.0.2 synthesises a native `CGEvent` double-click at the slider centre, types the target BPM via `CGEventKeyboard`, and presses Return. Verified on live Logic Pro 12.0.1 (120 → 140, exact). Falls back to `AXIncrement` (10-BPM granularity) if the typed entry doesn't commit within the verification window.

- **`record_sequence` regions are audible on playback.** The SMF-import path created a new MIDI track but sometimes without a Software Instrument plugin loaded, yielding silent regions. v3.0.2 post-processes the imported track: selects it and auto-calls `track.set_instrument` with a safe default (`Synthesizer/Bass`). Callers can override via a new `instrument_path` parameter. Response now includes an `instrument` field reporting the load outcome.

### Added

- `Sources/LogicProMCP/Accessibility/AXMouseHelper.swift` — native CGEvent-based double-click, numeric typing, Return/Escape. No osascript spawning (avoids the FD-leak path that disabled the v2.x tempo fallback). Re-used for any future "double-click-to-edit" slider surfaces.
- `AXLogicProElements.findTempoSlider` — locates the tempo slider through three fallback roots (control bar → transport bar → main window) so it works both with production AX trees and the test-double AX trees used in unit tests.
- `logic_tracks.record_sequence` accepts an optional `instrument_path: String` (also `instrument`) to choose the post-import Software Instrument preset.

### Still manual in v3.0.2 (follow-up)

- `transport.set_cycle_range` — cycle locators aren't standard sliders in the control bar; their UI lives in the ruler/timeline and needs a different discovery path.
- Full Sound Library download — `Logic Pro → Sound Library…` opens a modal with its own "Select All / Install" controls; driving it end-to-end requires a multi-step dialog script.
- Deep Library tree scan — current scan enumerates only 1 level (category → preset). Sub-preset navigation works via `set_instrument { path: "Synthesizer/Bass/Analog Monster" }` if the caller already knows the path.

## [3.0.1] — 2026-04-20

Release-path and docs-honesty hotfix on top of v3.0.0. **No runtime behavior changes** — same 8 tools, 9 resources, 3 templates. Upgrade is a docs + CI + packaging refresh.

### Fixed

- **Architecture claims match reality.** Locally-built ADHOC releases are `arm64`-native (produced by `swift build -c release` without Xcode); Intel Macs run the binary under Rosetta 2. The v3.0.0 release asset named `…-universal.tar.gz` was bit-identical to `…-arm64.tar.gz` — technically arm64 masquerading as universal. v3.0.1 keeps both tarball names for Homebrew-tap backward compatibility but `manifest.json`, `README.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, `docs/MAINTAINERS.md`, and `Formula/logic-pro-mcp.rb` now all state `arm64` native + Intel via Rosetta. CI with full Xcode still produces a genuine fat binary.
- **`release.yml` is dual-mode (notarized + ADHOC).** Previously the workflow hard-required `MACOS_CERT_BASE64` and 6 other Apple-Developer secrets, so every tag push failed visibly (red X on every release since v2.3.0). v3.0.1 detects secret presence at runtime: notarized path when present, ADHOC (`codesign --sign -`) when absent. Both paths publish `RELEASE-METADATA.json` with correct `signing` field (`notarized`|`adhoc`). CI `validate-install` matrix now runs end-to-end on every release.
- **README test-count unified.** Badge, body paragraph, and release notes now consistently cite **760 passing** (was drifting between 700 badge / 759 body / 760 notes).
- **Migration guidance expanded.** CHANGELOG §Migration now includes before/after examples for `set_instrument` (empty-call rejection) and `goto_position` (`time` alias removed).

### Added

- `Scripts/release.sh` — one-command ADHOC release that (1) builds + adhoc-codesigns the binary, (2) computes SHAs, (3) patches `Formula/logic-pro-mcp.rb` + commits Formula sync, (4) creates tag, (5) creates GitHub release with artifacts — in the right order. Prevents the v3.0.0 issue where the Formula SHA commit landed on `main` *after* the tag, leaving the tag with a stale sha256.
- `docs/MAINTAINERS.md` now documents both release modes, the `Scripts/release.sh` wrapper, and the post-tag Homebrew SHA-sync step more clearly.

### Security

- No security changes in v3.0.1. The round-4/5 hardening (fail-closed installer, symlink validation, JSON validation, rate-limit cap, ISO 8601 alignment, Logger/JSON thread-safety) remains in place from v3.0.0.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-19

> Renumbered from 2.4.0 to 3.0.0 to honor SemVer — the changes below break
> the track-mutation and `record_sequence` contracts, which is a major bump.
> The v2.4.0 tag was a pre-release and should be considered yanked in favor
> of v3.0.0.

### Breaking Changes

- **All mutating `logic_tracks` commands now require explicit `index`**. Previously `index` defaulted to `0` when missing, which silently mutated track 0 on malformed caller requests. Commands affected: `select`, `delete`, `duplicate`, `rename`, `mute`, `solo`, `arm`, `arm_only`, `set_automation`, `set_instrument`. Requests missing or with non-numeric `index` now return `isError: true`.
- **`arm_only` no longer buries failures in a success payload**. If the primary arm fails, or if any disarm fails, the command returns `isError: true` with detail. The structured JSON payload (`{armed, armedSuccess, disarmed, failedDisarm, detail}`) is reserved for complete success.
- **`record_sequence` no longer returns `track_index_confirmed`**. The dispatcher now polls the AX cache for up to 2 seconds and returns `isError: true` if the new track never appears — the fallback value (`false` + last-known-index) was a silent correctness hazard. On success, `created_track` is always the real new track index.
- **`record_sequence` hard-fails when `transport.goto_position bar=1` fails**. Logic Pro anchors imported regions at the playhead; a failed pre-reset would silently place notes at the wrong bar. The step is now a blocking precondition.
- **`set_instrument` requires `path` OR both `category` + `preset`**. Empty calls (only `index`) are rejected instead of silently dispatching with no instrument target.
- **`goto_position` canonicalises the position key**. Only `{ bar }` or `{ position }` are accepted — the undocumented `time` alias was removed so the API contract, tool description, and runtime now all agree on a single key. Both `B.B.S.S` and `HH:MM:SS:FF` formats remain supported.
- **`logic_system.health.logic_pro_running` now uses the same source of truth as `logic_project.is_running`**. Previously `health` OR-ed an AppleScript availability flag into the bit, which could disagree with `is_running`'s PID-based check. AppleScript status remains surfaced separately in the `channels` array.

### Added

- **`select` now fail-closes on malformed `index`**. A request like `{"index":"abc"}` is rejected with a clear error instead of silently selecting track 0.
- **Explicit-index regression tests** for every mutating command (8 new tests in `DispatcherTests.swift`).
- **Universal + arm64 release tarballs**. The release workflow now publishes both `LogicProMCP-macOS-universal.tar.gz` and `LogicProMCP-macOS-arm64.tar.gz` (same fat binary, two names) so existing Homebrew taps and arm64-only users both resolve cleanly.
- **GitHub Actions pin to commit SHA**. `actions/checkout` and `softprops/action-gh-release` are now pinned to immutable commit hashes instead of mutable tags, closing a supply-chain gap in the release workflow.

### Fixed

- `docs/API.md` now matches runtime behavior: `arm_only` error paths, `record_sequence` success schema (no `track_index_confirmed`), `set_automation` full mode enum (incl. `trim`), `set_instrument` required-field semantics.
- `Scripts/live-e2e-test.py` updated to reflect v3.0.0 contract: rejects-without-index assertions, new `set_instrument` error messages, softer environment gates.

### Security

- Release workflow dependencies pinned to commit SHA (supply-chain hardening).
- **Release tag trigger narrowed to strict SemVer** (`v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` with optional pre-release suffix). Arbitrary `v*` tags no longer unlock signing secrets in GitHub Actions.
- **Installer warns when provenance is fetched from the same release surface.** `Scripts/install.sh` now prints a hardening recommendation when `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_SHA256` / `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_TEAM_ID` aren't passed out-of-band.
- **Installer trust model documented.** `README.md` now leads with Homebrew as the hardened path and marks `bash <(curl ...)` as a convenience path that does **not** protect the installer script itself. `SECURITY.md §Installer trust model` lays out three trust tiers.
- **`logic://mcu/state` uses `JSONEncoder`** instead of a hand-rolled escaper, so MCU LCD bytes and port names carrying control characters (`\n`/`\r`/`\t`/U+0000-U+001F) now produce valid JSON instead of breaking parsers.
- **`JSONHelper` shared encoders are lock-gated** — concurrent MCP tool handlers can't race on `JSONEncoder` internal state.
- **`Logger` rate-limit map has a 1024-entry cap** with expired-window sweep + oldest-eviction, preventing a long-running daemon from inflating memory via user-controlled log strings.
- **`logic://library/inventory` resolves through three candidate paths** (`LOGIC_PRO_MCP_LIBRARY_INVENTORY` env override → repo-relative → `~/Library/Application Support/LogicProMCP/`) and emits a `Log.warn` on miss, so daemon launches where CWD=`/` no longer silently report an empty library.

### Fixed — drift from prior review

- `docs/API.md` header now advertises **9 resources + 3 templates** (was 6 + 1).
- `docs/API.md` `select` entry now documents the actual matching semantics (`localizedCaseInsensitiveContains`, not case-sensitive-first-match).
- `logic_system.help` default section matches the new resource/template counts.
- `Scripts/live-e2e-test.py` resource-list assertions updated to the v3.0.0 surface (9 resources, 3 templates, MCU filtered when disconnected).
- `manifest.json` and `docs/{MAINTAINERS,SETUP}.md` now advertise the universal binary consistently with `Formula/logic-pro-mcp.rb` and `release.yml` (no more arm64-vs-universal drift).

### Fixed — round 5 (final hardening pass)

- **`release.yml` tag trigger is now valid glob, not regex.** Previous pattern used `[0-9]+` which GitHub Actions treats as literal `+` (not repetition), so the `v3.0.0` tag would not have triggered the workflow and the notarized/signed release path would have been unreachable. Replaced with `v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*` (+ pre-release variant) and added a step-level strict-SemVer regex guard that fails the workflow before any secret-using step.
- **Installer is fail-closed by default.** `Scripts/install.sh` now refuses to run unless `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_SHA256` + `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_TEAM_ID` are both supplied. Opting into the same-origin (provenance fetched from the same release as the binary) path requires an explicit `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_ALLOW_SAME_ORIGIN=1`. The CI `validate-install` job now resolves pins from the freshly-published `SHA256SUMS.txt` and `RELEASE-METADATA.json`, so it exercises the hardened path end-to-end.
- **`README.md` and `docs/SETUP.md` lead with Homebrew.** The one-line `bash <(curl ...)` path is demoted to "download-inspect-run" with explicit `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_ALLOW_SAME_ORIGIN` opt-in guidance.
- **Testing claims match fresh evidence.** README no longer says "700+ tests all passing, Live E2E verified"; it reports the actual `swift test` count (759) and clarifies that live E2E assertions are split between environment-independent (pass cleanly) and Logic-Pro-gated (require a live session).
- **`logic://library/inventory` now validates JSON before serving.** `ResourceHandlers.readLibraryInventory` parses the file with `JSONSerialization` and falls through to the next candidate on malformed input, so a corrupt or attacker-shaped cache file can't be returned under the `application/json` mimetype.
- **Public contract surfaces converged.** `docs/API.md` Resource Catalog lists all 9 resources + 3 templates, `set_tempo` range (5–999) matches runtime in API.md, tool description, and `logic_system help`. `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` startup-banner example reflects v3.0.0 counts. `README.md` documentation table lists "9 resources, 3 templates" instead of the stale "6 resources".

### Fixed — round 4 (production-readiness pass)

- **ISO 8601 fractional-second precision is preserved across the wire.** Shared `JSONEncoder`/`JSONDecoder` now use a custom date strategy matching `Logger`'s `[.withInternetDateTime, .withFractionalSeconds]` formatter, so `logic://mcu/state.connection.lastFeedbackAt` and every other `Date` field stay aligned with the log timestamp format. Previously `JSONEncoder.iso8601` silently truncated sub-second precision.
- **`LOGIC_PRO_MCP_LIBRARY_INVENTORY` env override now resists symlink abuse.** `validateLibraryInventoryPath` resolves symlinks, refuses anything that isn't a regular `.json` file ≤ 64 MiB, and logs the resolved path on rejection. Removes the "hostile daemon-env var points MCP at `/etc/passwd`" class of attacks.
- **`goto_position` now fails closed on unknown param keys.** Previously a caller sending the legacy `{ "time": "…" }` alias would silently seek to `"1.1.1.1"`; now the dispatcher returns an explicit error naming the removed key and the allowed set (`bar`, `position`).
- **`encodeJSON` fallback path uses a full JSON escape helper** (`jsonStringEscape`) covering `"`, `\`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, and U+0000-U+001F. Previous escaping missed control characters, which would have produced invalid JSON if a future Foundation error message carried them.
- **`StatePoller.Runtime` gains an injectable `sleep` closure.** Tests can now drive the poll loop at 1 µs cadence instead of waiting out the production 3 s interval. The two lifecycle tests (`testStatePollerStartStopLifecycle` and `testLogicProServerStartCoversDefaultPortAndPollerLifecyclePaths`) used to take ~2 000 s each and were excluded from CI; with the injectable sleep + `.fastTest` runtime (which also short-circuits `hasVisibleWindow` to avoid live AX calls) they now complete in ≤ 20 ms each and are included in the default test run.
- `docs/MAINTAINERS.md` now documents the runtime env matrix (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FORMAT`, `LOGIC_PRO_MCP_LIBRARY_INVENTORY`, installer pins) and the post-tag Homebrew `sha256` sync step.

### Migration from v2.3.x

Replace every mutating `logic_tracks.*` call with an explicit `index`:

```diff
- logic_tracks rename { "name": "Lead Vox" }
+ logic_tracks rename { "index": 0, "name": "Lead Vox" }

- logic_tracks mute { "enabled": true }
+ logic_tracks mute { "index": 3, "enabled": true }
```

For `arm_only` and `record_sequence`, check `isError` before parsing the JSON payload. Previous `armedSuccess: false` / `track_index_confirmed: false` responses are now returned as structured errors.

#### `set_instrument` now requires a selector

```diff
- logic_tracks set_instrument { "index": 0 }
+ logic_tracks set_instrument { "index": 0, "path": "Electronic Drums/Roland TR-909" }
# or
+ logic_tracks set_instrument { "index": 0, "category": "Synthesizer", "preset": "Vintage Mono" }
```

#### `goto_position` renames `time` → `position`

```diff
- logic_transport goto_position { "time": "00:00:10:12" }
+ logic_transport goto_position { "position": "00:00:10:12" }

- logic_transport goto_position { "time": "9.1.1.1" }
+ logic_transport goto_position { "position": "9.1.1.1" }
# or
+ logic_transport goto_position { "bar": 9 }
```

Sending `{ "time": ... }` in v3.0.0+ returns an explicit error naming the removed key.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`record_sequence` now places regions at the requested bar reliably.** Live verification revealed that Logic Pro's MIDI File Import anchors the imported region to the current playhead position — a bar=1 request on a session whose playhead had drifted to bar 129 produced a region at bar 129. The fix forces the playhead to bar 1 before every import via the `탐색 → 이동 → 위치…` dialog (auto-extends project length; slider path was silently clamping). Strategy D padding CC continues to position notes within the region at the requested bar.
- **`transport.goto_position` no longer silently clamps to project length.** Previous implementation used the 마디 slider whose value is clipped to the active project's end bar. A `goto_position bar=50` on an 8-bar project stopped at bar 8 with a success response. The new implementation uses the dialog (which auto-extends the project) as the primary path and falls back to slider only when the dialog is disabled (empty project).
- **Dialog-keystroke race eliminated.** The previous `delay 0.5` assumed the Go-to-Position dialog would render within 500 ms. On slow machines the Cmd+A keystroke reached the arrange area instead, silently triggering "Select All Regions." The dialog-ready state is now polled with a 3-second timeout.

### Security

- `midi.import_file` now restricts its `path` parameter to `/tmp/LogicProMCP/*.mid`. The only legitimate producer is `TrackDispatcher.record_sequence` (UUID-generated temp paths); external MCP callers cannot point the AX file dialog at arbitrary filesystem locations.

### Testing

- `testRecordSequenceSMFImportHappyPath` now asserts that `transport.goto_position` with `bar=1` is routed BEFORE `midi.import_file`. Catches silent regression of the v2.3.1 bar-positioning invariant.

### Documentation

- `docs/API.md`: documented the dialog-path latency for `transport.goto_position` (~800 ms), and marked `recorded_to_track` as a legacy alias for `created_track`.
- `ChannelRouter.swift`: inline comment on `region.select_last` / `region.move_to_playhead` clarifying they are reserved for a future region-editor tool (record_sequence does not use them).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`logic_tracks.record_sequence` — full rewrite via server-side SMF generation + AX File Import**
  - Replaces the broken real-time recording path (record-arm latency + silent error swallowing). SMFWriter emits a Type 0 Standard MIDI File; AccessibilityChannel drives `File → Import → MIDI File…` to load the file into the current project. Note timing is now byte-exact with zero drift regardless of system load.
  - **Strategy D — tick-0 padding CC** bypasses Logic's MIDI-import quirk of stripping leading empty delta. When `bar > 1`, SMFWriter emits a harmless `CC#110 val 0` at tick 0 so Logic preserves the full tick timeline; the caller's notes land at exactly the encoded positions inside a region that spans bar 1 through the target bar. Verified live on Logic Pro 12: `bar=50` request produces a region explicitly described by Logic as "1 마디에서 시작하여 51 마디에서 끝납니다".
  - Response schema: `{ recorded_to_track, created_track, track_index_confirmed, bar, note_count, method: "smf_import" }`. `track_index_confirmed` is `false` when the AX cache hadn't observed the new track within 500 ms — caller should re-read `logic://tracks` if a confirmed index is needed.
  - Hard upper limit lifted from 256 → 1024 notes (bounded by SMFWriter). Tempo/time-signature come from the `StateCache` (override via `tempo` param).
- **`logic_tracks.arm_only` — error propagation fix**
  - Response now carries `armedSuccess: Bool`, `disarmed: [Int]`, `failedDisarm: [Int]`, and `detail: String`. `armed` kept as the int target index for backward compatibility. Closes H-4 finding.
- **`logic_navigate.goto_bar` — real channel**
  - Delegates to `transport.goto_position` (AX bar-slider); the dead `nav.goto_bar` route (`[.mcu, .cgEvent]` with no handler) is removed.
- **`logic_navigate.goto_marker { name: ... }` — now works**
  - `StatePoller` calls a new `AccessibilityChannel.nav.get_markers` operation every 5th tick (~15 s) and pushes the parsed list into `StateCache.updateMarkers`. Name-based lookup now has a populated cache to consult.
- **`SMFWriter` (new internal module)** — Type 0 SMF generator with VLQ encoding, tempo + time-signature meta events, round-half-up ms→tick conversion, bar-offset positioning, up to 1024 notes. No public MCP surface — internal helper for `record_sequence`.
- **`SMFWriter.cleanupOrphanFiles(in:olderThan:)`** — server startup sweeps `/tmp/LogicProMCP/` for `.mid` files older than 5 minutes, reclaiming space from crash-interrupted imports.
- **New operations in the routing table**: `midi.import_file` (AX), `region.move_to_playhead` (AX), `region.select_last` (AX). `midi.import_file` is the primary consumer; the other two are experimental helpers retained for future region-editing tools.

### Changed

- `StatePoller` marker polling now runs every 5th transport tick rather than every cycle. Markers change infrequently and AX enumeration is relatively expensive (~9 s at 3 s poll interval); this trades freshness for AX-query overhead.
- Binary is now self-signed on install (adhoc codesign replaces the GitHub Actions build signature) so macOS TCC treats the installed path as consistent across updates, avoiding silent "not permitted" failures when the binary hash changes but the path stays the same.

### Fixed

- `get_regions` used to return `[]` with `_debug.layoutItems: 0` when regions existed under certain AX tree shapes. Same-release change: the poller now walks the arrange area recursively via `entire contents` in addition to the direct-child path.
- `record_sequence` no longer silently swallows mid-step failures. Every step (`select` → `arm_only` → `SMFWriter.generate` → file write → `midi.import_file`) propagates errors back to the caller with the failing channel in the message.

### Removed

- The real-time CoreMIDI recording path previously used by `record_sequence` (goto → record → sleep → play_sequence → stop) is gone. `midi.play_sequence` remains for live-performance callers; it is no longer invoked by `record_sequence`.
- `nav.goto_bar` entry in `ChannelRouter.v2RoutingTable` (no channel implemented it; clients now hit `transport.goto_position` via `NavigateDispatcher`).

### Documentation

- `docs/prd/PRD-record-sequence-smf-import.md` (v0.4) — full PRD with 3 Phase-2 review rounds, 2 Phase-6 Ralph iterations, and live OQ-1/OQ-2/OQ-3 probe results embedded.
- `docs/tickets/record-sequence-smf-import/` — 7 dev tickets (T1-T7) with TDD specs.
- `docs/tickets/navigate-redesign/STATUS.md` — marked Done with T1/T2/T3 evidence.
- `docs/tickets/installer-supply-chain/` — resolution: pinned SHA256 hash in `Scripts/install.sh` (implemented in 2.3.0). See §Security below.

### Security

- `Scripts/install.sh` now verifies the downloaded binary against a pinned SHA256 hash published alongside the release. Install aborts on mismatch. This closes the supply-chain gap where a mutated release asset could be served by a compromised mirror without the installer noticing.
- `AccessibilityChannel.midi.import_file` uses the same `AppleScriptSafety.openFile` (NSWorkspace) injection-safe path as `project.open` — no shell interpolation reaches the file dialog.

### Testing

- +2 SMFWriter tests (`testSMFWriterEmitsPaddingCCWhenBarOffsetIsNonZero`, `testSMFWriterNoPaddingWhenBarIsOne`)
- +2 SMFWriter orphan-cleanup tests
- +5 TrackDispatcher tests (`arm_only` partial-failure visibility + `record_sequence` SMF-import happy path + error chain + invalid notes + hasDocument guard)
- +3 StatePoller marker-polling tests
- +2 NavigateDispatcher `goto_bar` delegation tests
- **Total**: 668 → 690 tests (+22). All pass.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- `logic_project.get_regions` — read-only AX scan of the arrange area, parses Logic's AXHelp bar-position strings into `[RegionInfo]` JSON (English + Korean locales). Enables programmatic verification of `record_sequence` region placement without screenshots.
- `logic_tracks.arm_only` — composite "disarm every track, then arm exactly one", closing the multi-armed duplicate-record hole.
- `logic_tracks.record_sequence` — composite `select → arm_only → record → play → stop` for one-shot natural-language recording (⚠️ still subject to the record-arm latency bug tracked in `record_sequence sync bug` memory; use `send_chord`/`send_note` for reliable demos).
- `logic_mixer.set_plugin_param` — deterministic plugin-parameter control via Scripter on the currently-selected track.
- `logic_tracks.set_instrument`, `list_library`, `scan_library`, `resolve_path`, `scan_plugin_presets` — Library-panel enumeration + preset loading via AX.
- `StateCache.selectOnly(trackAt:)` actor mutator — preserves Logic's single-selection model when MCU select events arrive.

### Changed

- `logic://transport/state` resource now returns a wrapper object:
  `{ state: TransportState, has_document: Bool, transport_age_sec: Double }`.
  Clients can detect "no project open" / "stale snapshot" without cross-referencing `logic://system/health`. **Breaking** for clients reading top-level `tempo`, `isPlaying`, etc. — they now live under `.state`.
- `logic_project.close` now honours the documented `saving: "yes" | "no" | "ask"` parameter (previously always coerced to `"yes"`). Invalid values return an explicit error instead of silently saving.
- `StateCache.clearProjectState()` now also resets `transport` so the resource stops reporting the previous project's playback state after close.
- `MCUFeedbackParser` enforces single-track selection on every "select on" event, preventing multiple tracks from appearing selected simultaneously.
- Distribution version aligned at **2.2.0** across `ServerConfig.serverVersion` (SSOT), `Formula/logic-pro-mcp.rb`, `manifest.json`, `Scripts/install.sh`. `VersionConsistencyTests` pins this going forward.
- `Formula/logic-pro-mcp.rb` now installs helper assets (`docs/MCU-SETUP.md`, `Scripts/install-keycmds.sh` + siblings, `Scripts/LogicProMCP-Scripter.js`) into `pkgshare`; release workflow packs them into the tarball.
- `docs/API.md` + `README.md` synced with the shipped surface (record_sequence/arm_only/get_regions documented with known-limitation callouts, navigate gaps disclosed, insert/bypass_plugin marked removed, poll interval corrected to 3 s).

### Removed

- `logic_mixer.insert_plugin`, `logic_mixer.bypass_plugin` — had no channel with a working implementation; every call produced a dressed-up error. Use `set_plugin_param` on the selected track via Scripter instead. Router entries and AX stub branches pruned so there is no side-channel resurrection path.
- `plugin.insert`, `plugin.bypass`, `plugin.remove` router-table entries.
- `StateModels.PluginState` + nested `PluginParam` (unreferenced).
- `ServerConfig.channelHealthCheckTimeout` (unreferenced since initial commit).
- `AXValueExtractors.extractCheckboxState` + companion test assertions (referenced only by its own unit test; production callers use `extractButtonState`).

### Moved

- `Scripts/library-ax-probe.swift`, `plugin-detective.swift`, `plugin-menu-ax-probe.swift`, `setting-popup-probe.swift` → `Scripts/probes/`. Developer-only investigation scripts are isolated from operational install/uninstall/e2e scripts. SwiftPM target unaffected.

### Documentation

- New ticket drafts:
  - `docs/tickets/navigate-redesign/` — T1 (goto_bar real channel), T2 (marker cache population), T3 (contract alignment).
  - `docs/tickets/installer-supply-chain/` — same-release verification root mitigation options (awaiting Isaac's decision).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-12

### Security

Nine vulnerabilities identified and fixed during the production-readiness review.

- **P0** — AX Save-As dialog accepted unvalidated paths. `saveAsViaAXDialog` now guards with `AppleScriptSafety.isValidProjectPath` before writing into the dialog (`AccessibilityChannel.swift`).
- **P1** — `DispatchQueue.main.sync` could deadlock in a CLI process without an active AppKit runloop. `ProcessUtils.runAppKit` now probes `CFRunLoopIsWaiting(CFRunLoopGetMain())` and returns `nil` when the main runloop is unavailable, letting callers fall back to the subprocess path.
- **P1** — MIDI packet traversal used raw pointer arithmetic without bounding `wordCount`. Added `min(wordCount, 64)` bound in `ProductionMCUTransport` before indexing into the UMP packet buffer.
- **P1** — `ServerConfig.logicProProcessName` was interpolated into AppleScript without escaping. Added `\\` and `"` escaping before interpolation in `ProcessUtils.logicProPIDViaSystemEvents`.
- **P2** — Track rename accepted unbounded names. Truncated to 255 chars with JSON-escaped response.
- **P2** — Virtual MIDI port names passed newlines/null bytes to CoreMIDI. Filter newlines/nulls and truncate to 63 chars in `midi.create_virtual_port`.
- **P2** — `stepInputDurationMs`, `send_note.duration_ms`, and `send_chord.duration_ms` were unbounded. Capped at 30,000 ms to prevent actor DoS.
- **P2** — `verifyOpenedProjectScript` and `saveProjectAsScript` incomplete escaping. Added `\n` / `\r` stripping.
- **P2** — `PermissionChecker.runAutomationProbeViaShell` used nested shell quoting. Replaced with direct `/usr/bin/osascript -e` invocation.

### Added

- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers installed in `MainEntrypoint.run` via `DispatchSource` so the server exits cleanly (channels stopped, MIDI ports released) instead of being killed with resources held.
- **Configurable state polling interval** — new `ServerConfig.statePollingIntervalNs` (default 3 s; initially introduced at 5 s and tightened to 3 s in the v2.2 census sync) replaces the previously hardcoded value in `StatePoller`.
- **E2E test suite** — `EndToEndTests.swift` (93 tests) covering tool → dispatcher → router → channel chains, resource reads, lifecycle, concurrency, and input validation.
- **Production readiness tests** — `ProductionReadinessTests.swift` (26 tests) verifying all security fixes, duration caps, path validation, port name sanitization.
- **Live E2E test runner** — `scripts/live-e2e-test.py` drives the actual binary against a running Logic Pro instance (229 tests across 20 sections).
- **Comprehensive documentation** — new `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/MCU-SETUP.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- **Launch agent template** — `scripts/com.logicpro.mcp.plist.template` for operators who need the MCP server available outside Claude Code sessions.

### Changed

- **`StatePoller.stop()` is now `async`** and awaits in-flight poll cycles before returning, avoiding races where the cancelled poll loop could still touch the cache after `stop()` returned.
- **`ProcessUtils.runAppKit<T>` returns `T?`** instead of `T`. Callers must unwrap or fall back. This is a breaking change at the Swift API level but internal-only.
- **`StatePoller` decoder** now uses `dateDecodingStrategy = .iso8601` to match the encoder, fixing a silent decode failure on `lastUpdated` that caused project/transport polls to be dropped.

### Removed

Dead code cleanup — ~43 lines of production code and ~40 lines of duplicated test helpers.

- `MCUChannel.executePluginParam` (orphaned method, routing sends `mixer.set_plugin_param` to Scripter).
- `ProcessUtils.logicProRunningViaAppleScript` (private, never called).
- `AppleScriptSafety.shouldUseNSWorkspaceForOpen` (dead marker constant).
- `MIDIEngine.sendPolyAftertouch` (production never sent polyphonic aftertouch).
- `MCUProtocol.isDeviceResponse` (test-only wrapper over `parseDeviceResponse`).
- 11 operations in `MIDIKeyCommandsChannel.mappingTable` that had no entry in `ChannelRouter.v2RoutingTable` (`automation.off/read/touch/latch`, `edit.force_legato`, `edit.remove_overlaps`, `edit.trim_at_playhead`, `project.export_midi`, `transport.toggle_click`, `view.toggle_list_editors`, `view.toggle_score`).

### Tests

- Total: **500 Swift tests** + **229 live E2E tests** passing.
- New consolidated `SharedTestHelpers.swift` eliminates duplicate `toolText`, `resourceText`, and `ServerStartRecorder` helpers across 5 test files.
