  # arm64-native binary. Intel Macs run under Rosetta 2 — functional but
  # slower + with minor CoreMIDI / AX timing differences. The release workflow
  # with full Xcode + `swift build --arch arm64 --arch x86_64` would emit a
  # true universal binary; ADHOC local releases ship arm64 only. The tarball
  # is published under both `-arm64` and `-universal` names for backward
  # compatibility with taps that hardcoded the older URL — the bytes are
  # identical.
  #
  # NOTE: sha256 below is the v3.0.1 adhoc-signed tarball shipped on GitHub.
  #       Update every release from the published SHA256SUMS.txt.

      Logic Pro MCP Server is installed at #{bin}/LogicProMCP.

      Register with Claude Code:
        claude mcp add --scope user logic-pro -- LogicProMCP

      Check macOS permissions:
        LogicProMCP --check-permissions

      Complete Logic Pro integration (MCU, Key Commands, Scripter):
        open #{pkgshare}/SETUP.md

      Approve manual-validation channels after Logic Pro setup:
        LogicProMCP --approve-channel MIDIKeyCommands
        LogicProMCP --approve-channel Scripter
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Verify the binary runs and exits cleanly on --check-permissions
    output = shell_output("#{bin}/LogicProMCP --check-permissions 2>&1", 1)
    assert_match(/Accessibility/, output)
    assert_match(/Automation/, output)
