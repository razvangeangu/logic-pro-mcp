  # NOTE (v3.1.6): no `depends_on xcode:` — this Formula installs the
  # pre-built GitHub release binary; it does not invoke `swift build` or any
  # Apple toolchain. Source builds via `Package.swift` still require Xcode
  # 15.0+ (Swift 6.0+).

    # Issue #22: these paths must match the tarball layout staged by
    # .github/workflows/release.yml, which packages repo-relative nested
    # paths (docs/, Scripts/). Homebrew flattens them into pkgshare by
    # basename, which install-keycmds.sh relies on (sibling preset lookup).
    # Guarded both ways: VersionConsistencyTests at PR time, and the
    # release workflow's tarball-listing gate at tag time.

    <<~EOS
      Logic Pro MCP Server is installed at #{bin}/LogicProMCP.

      Register with Claude Code:
        claude mcp add --scope user logic-pro -- LogicProMCP

      Check macOS permissions:
        LogicProMCP --check-permissions

      Complete Logic Pro integration (MCU, Key Commands, Scripter):
        open #{pkgshare}/SETUP.md

      Approve manual-validation channels after Logic Pro setup:
        LogicProMCP --approve-channel MIDIKeyCommands
        LogicProMCP --approve-channel Scripter
    EOS

  test do
    # Verify the binary runs and prints the expected report shape on
    # `--check-permissions`. Exit code is 0 when both Accessibility and
    # Logic Automation are granted (typical Logic-installed dev box) and
    # non-zero when at least one is missing (typical CI). Don't constrain
    # the test to a specific code — both are valid; the report contents
    # are the contract this test guards.
