# Channel EQ AX Parameter Census

**Status: GATE FAILED (2026-07-07) — registry activation honest-deferred.** Scaffold ships; no production Channel EQ verified param is activated.

Source script: `Scripts/spike-channel-eq-census.py`
Enumerator: `logic_plugins.get_inventory` for insert-slot readback, then read-only System Events AX crawl of the open Channel EQ editor window.

## Run Metadata

- Date: 2026-07-07
- Logic Pro version: 12.x (server baseline 3.8.0)
- macOS: Retina 1920×1080 logical
- System locale: Korean; Logic UI language: English
- Project: `~/Music/Logic/Untitled 54.logicx` (scratch)
- Track index: 1 (Audio 1); Insert index: 0
- Probe command: `python3 Scripts/spike-channel-eq-census.py`

## What WORKS (verified live)

- **`logic_plugins.insert_verified "Channel EQ"` → State A.** Inserted `logic.stock.effect.channel_eq` at slot 0 via `ax_exact_slot_popup`, verified by `ax_plugin_inventory` (this is the existing shipped verified-insert path — solid).
- Plugin editor opens as an `AXDialog` window titled by track name (`Audio 1`), with 15 top-level UI elements including a **View menu** (`AXMenuButton` desc=`view`) offering **`Controls`** and **`Editor`** view modes.

## The wall (why parameter census + registry activation is deferred)

The Channel EQ **parameter controls are not reachable through standard AX traversal** in either view mode:

- **Editor (graphical) view**: parameters are drawn on a custom `AXGroup` (desc=`EQ`) canvas — no per-band `AXSlider`/`AXValueIndicator` exposed. `entire contents` of the window filtered for slider/value roles = empty.
- **Controls view**: switching via the View menu works, but `entire contents` of the plugin window then returns **0 elements** — the AU parameter view is a hosted/remote view opaque to host-process AX recursion (same opacity class as the out-of-process save panel in the T5 spike). The graphical `EQ` group is gone and no traversable slider tree replaces it.
- The existing shipped verified-param path only ever activated **one** parameter (Compressor `threshold`, a single earlier T0 spike; every other param fails closed with `unsupported_param_readback` — see `AccessibilityChannel+VerifiedPlugins.swift:509`). Channel EQ's per-band freq/gain/Q are not reachable by the same `AXSlider`-by-description mechanism.

Per PRD AC-6.1 the registry may only be filled from real census values (guessing AX ids/units/tolerances is explicitly forbidden). Since the AX surface does not expose those values here, **no registry entry is activated.** The scaffold (census probe, inert TODO entries, test seam) ships ready for a future run on a build/host where the AU parameter view is AX-traversable, or via a different enumeration surface (e.g. an AU parameter API rather than the GUI).

## Parameter Census

Not obtainable in this environment (AU parameter view AX-opaque). Table intentionally left unfilled — activating entries from non-evidence would violate AC-6.1/AC-6.3.

## Registry Decisions

- Production Channel EQ entries: **left inert (TODO)** — none activated.
- Unregistered Channel EQ params continue to fail closed with `unsupported_param_readback` (unchanged contract).

## Follow-up candidates (not this PR)

- Enumerate AU parameters via the AudioUnit parameter API (`AudioUnitGetProperty`/`kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterList`) instead of the GUI AX tree — would bypass the opaque hosted view entirely and is the most promising path to a real census.
- Investigate whether a specific Logic build or the "Controls" view exposes `AXSlider` descriptions on other hosts.

## rename_marker spike (AC-6.6) — DEFERRED

Same session probe: `logic_navigate.create_marker` did not surface a renamable marker in `logic://markers` (list read empty post-create; markers require the Marker global track / Marker List visible, and a verified rename needs a reliable AX text-edit path this environment has not demonstrated — cf. the goto-position "마디 slider not found" and save-panel keyboard-routing walls). rename_marker remains `not_implemented` (unchanged); no false capability advertised.
