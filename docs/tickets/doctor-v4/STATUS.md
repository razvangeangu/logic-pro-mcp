# Pipeline Status: Doctor v4 — Intent-Aware, Source-Aware Readiness Platform

**PRD**: `docs/prd/PRD-doctor-v4.md`
**Status**: Landed — merged to main via PR #248 (c5133aa), CI SUCCESS, 2026-07-07; CTO-review P0/P1/P2 readiness false-green fixes included.
**Base**: Doctor v3 Done/PASS (`docs/tickets/doctor-v3/STATUS.md`)
**Execution rule**: sequential landing. No ticket may weaken v3 honesty or remove v3 checks.

## Board-Wide Binding Gates (apply to EVERY ticket — CTO v0.2)

1. **TDD**: red tests written and FAIL-verified before implementation; no dead-`#expect` forms (`optBool == true`, `?? false`, `== .some(true)` — repo footgun #92).
2. **Cumulative review**: on each ticket's completion, review T(n-1)+T(n) diff together + run the full `swift test --no-parallel` suite; every 5 tickets, full cumulative review T1..T(n).
3. **Live/evidence gate**: any ticket touching a real system surface (T1 remediation output, T3 resolver, T5 store CLI, T6 detection, T7 capabilities, T10 marker) ends with a local `doctor --json` (and profile variants where relevant) evidence capture attached to the PR.
4. **Manual QA gate**: per-ticket QA section is mandatory before Done.
5. **Honesty invariants**: no ticket may weaken v3 honesty (false-green 0 per profile scope, §5.1.1 PRD), remove v3 checks, execute arbitrary binaries (C4), or bypass the evidence builder once T9 lands.
6. **Sequential landing** (shared check metadata/test literals — parallel landing conflicts guaranteed).

## Per-Ticket Risk Register (CTO v0.2)

- T1: renderer/docs coupling — snapshot tests must change together (risk: docs drift).
- T2: aggregate semantics touched — regression risk on shipped optional-skip rule (`SetupDoctor+Rendering.swift:137`); FrozenV3 decode pins the wire.
- T3: supersedes shipped relative-command policy — must keep the resolution-basis honesty caveat (PRD §5.10) or it reintroduces a cross-context false-green.
- T4/T6: profile/client scoping — the §5.1.1 calculus is the contract; any deviation is a false-green vector. CI-honesty test per profile required.
- T5: store migration — legacy approvals must survive (data-loss risk); corrupt-store warning must not brick doctor.
- T7: capability table is DATA (PRD §5.3) — hard-coding it in logic makes T8 a rewrite; mixer_mcu capped at `unknown_live_verify_required` (hint-grade honesty).
- T8: registry must reproduce the exact shipped check order (order regression breaks the exact-id contract test).
- T9: central builder touches every check — highest regression surface; land late, full-suite + privacy scan.
- T10: marker effective only post-release (PRD §5.11); keep strings fallback or older-binary detection silently dies.

## Final Gate

- `swift test --no-parallel`
- `swift build -c release`
- `LogicProMCP doctor --json` for core/full/client profiles
- privacy scan of doctor JSON
- renderer snapshot for default/verbose/quiet
- docs anchor coverage
- FrozenV1/V2/V3 decode green (wire superset chain)

## T1 Review Evidence

- Focused tests: `swift test --filter 'DoctorSourceBuild|DoctorRemediationShellQuotesPaths|DoctorXattrEvidenceKeepsStdoutStderrSummary|DoctorCodesignEvidenceKeepsStdoutStderrSummary|DoctorUnknownLaunchContext'`
- Full suite: `swift test --no-parallel` (`2174` tests passed)
- Build: `swift build -c release`
- Surface smoke: `.build/release/LogicProMCP doctor --json`
- Diff hygiene: `git diff --check`

## Working Tree Verification Evidence

- Focused Doctor v4: `swift test --filter DoctorV4 --disable-xctest --parallel` (`14` tests passed)
- Focused Doctor v3 readiness: `swift test --filter DoctorV3ProductionReadiness --disable-xctest --parallel` (`16` tests passed)
- Focused SetupDoctor: `swift test --filter SetupDoctor --disable-xctest --parallel` (`102` tests passed)
- Full suite: `swift test --no-parallel` (`2184` tests passed)
- Build: `swift build -c release` (exit `0`)
- Surface smoke: `.build/release/LogicProMCP doctor --json --profile core --client cursor` emitted `schema=logic_pro_mcp_doctor.v4`, `doctor_profile=core`, `client_profile=cursor`, `status=degraded` due local install/TCC warnings.
- Diff hygiene: `git diff --check` (exit `0`)

## Landing Note

These tickets are merged and CI-verified on main via PR #248 at commit `c5133aa` on 2026-07-07. The landed state includes the follow-up CTO-review fixes for the P0 selected `claude-desktop` absent-config readiness false-green, P1 dropped-required-check, and P2 registry consistency issues.
