# Logic Pro MCP — Honest Contract

> Response contract that all mutating operations comply with starting from v3.1.0+.

## Why

GUI automation (AX, CoreMIDI, Scripter) is inherently asynchronous with limited verifiability. In v3.0.x the assumption was "AX write success = operation success", but in practice the write return code can succeed vacuously, or Logic can accept the write without the actual state changing.

The Honest Contract lets **clients (LLM agents) clearly distinguish between confirmed success, uncertain success, and failure**.

## 3-State Contract

### State A — Confirmed Success
```json
{"success": true, "verified": true, "requested": <X>, "observed": <X>}
```
- AX write succeeded and the actual state `<X>` was confirmed via read-back.
- The client can safely proceed to the next step.

### State B — Uncertain Success
```json
{"success": true, "verified": false, "reason": "<enum>", "requested": <X>, "observed": null | <Y>}
```
- The AX write returned `kAXErrorSuccess` or bytes were transmitted successfully.
- Read-back was unavailable, timed out, or returned a mismatch.
- `reason` values:
  - `echo_timeout_<ms>` — no MCU feedback echo within the window (± `2/16383` tolerance)
  - `readback_unavailable` — AX attribute not exposed (Logic version/state issue)
  - `readback_mismatch` — the read value (`observed`) differs from the requested value (`requested`). For `track.select`, a different index was selected.
  - `retry_exhausted` — read-back metadata did not surface after 6 retries (100 ms apart, 600 ms total). Distinct from `readback_mismatch`: the former means "value differs", the latter means "value never surfaced".
- The client must perform follow-up verification (e.g. query `logic://tracks`).

### State C — Hard Failure
```json
{"success": false, "error": "<enum>", "axCode": <int?>, "hint": "<str?>"}
```
- The AX write itself returned a `kAXError` or an explicit failure.
- Retrying will produce the same state — a different path is required.
- `error` values: `ax_write_failed`, `element_not_found`, `permission_denied`, `logic_not_running`, `invalid_params`, `readback_unavailable`, `readback_mismatch`, `not_implemented`, `port_unavailable`, `channels_exhausted`.
- **Terminal codes** (router suppresses fallback to the next channel): `element_not_found`, `invalid_params`, `readback_unavailable`, `not_implemented`, `port_unavailable`, `channels_exhausted`. Any of these means "no other channel in the chain can improve on this answer."
- `port_unavailable` vs `channels_exhausted` (v3.4.5-rc5+, Boomer BOOMER-6 / U):
  - `port_unavailable` — a specific channel's transport/port is missing (e.g. KeyCmd virtual port not yet published, CoreMIDI device absent). Emitted by a single channel that knows its own port is unwired.
  - `channels_exhausted` — the router walked the full chain for this operation and every channel reported `healthCheck.unavailable` or its readiness gate failed. Aggregate signal, distinct from any single channel's port state. Extras include `operation`, `hint`, and `last_error` carrying the final downstream message.

## Channel-specific extras (mixer writes — v3.4.5-rc5+)

The diagnostic triplet below is **MCU-specific**: it is emitted only by the three mixer fader/V-Pot write paths that depend on MCU echo for verification. Other mutating operations (`track.select`, `track.set_instrument`, `track.set_mute`, automation mode buttons, transport commands, etc.) do **not** carry these fields because their channels either do not depend on MCU feedback at all, or fall through the `readback_unavailable` State B branch where MCU connection state isn't part of the actionable diagnostic.

`mixer.set_volume`, `mixer.set_pan`, and `mixer.set_master_volume` carry three additional diagnostic fields on **every** State A and State B response (purely additive — existing parsers keep working):

```json
{
  "success": true, "verified": true | false, "reason": "<…>",
  "requested": 0.5, "observed": null,
  "track": 3,
  "mcu_connected": true,
  "mcu_registered": true,
  "mcu_last_feedback_age_ms": 142
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `mcu_connected` (Bool) | `true` once MCU feedback has been observed at least once this session; reset to `false` only when the channel restarts. |
| `mcu_registered` (Bool) | `true` once the virtual port has received at least one well-formed feedback frame on the LogicProMCP-MCU-Internal port. |
| `mcu_last_feedback_age_ms` (Int? / null) | Milliseconds since the most recent MCU feedback event. `null` when no feedback has been observed yet. Clamped to 0 to defend against system-clock-jump-induced negative intervals. |

Decision table for harnesses on State B `echo_timeout_<ms>ms`:

| `mcu_connected` | `mcu_last_feedback_age_ms` | Root cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `false` | `null` | Mackie Control device not registered in Logic Pro (or virtual port unbridged). Setup gap. |
| `true` | high (e.g. > 5000) | MCU pairing went stale mid-session. |
| `true` | low (sub-second) | Connection healthy, but this specific fader/V-Pot echo didn't land — points at a Logic-build regression or bank-offset mismatch. |

## HC v2 (`logic_plugins.*`, v3.6.0)

The verified plugin apply-back surface uses a stricter envelope so clients can distinguish legacy best-effort plugin writes from readback-gated apply-back operations.

All `logic_plugins.*` responses carry:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verified": true,
  "state": "A",
  "hc_schema": 2
}
```

State C always includes `verified:false`, and mutating failures include `write_attempted` whenever the implementation can know whether Logic was touched.

| Command | State A condition | Non-success rule |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| `logic_plugins.get_inventory` | AX inventory was read and every exposed slot is classified. | Mixer/AX subtree unavailable returns State B `readback_unavailable`; any unreadable occupied slot makes `complete:false`, and callers must not write. |
| `logic_plugins.insert_verified` | The requested stock plugin is observed by post-write inventory diff at the requested physical insert slot. | Track selection, incomplete inventory, occupied slot, unanchored popup, exact leaf miss, wrong-slot mount, rollback failure, or timeout returns State C. |
| `logic_plugins.set_param_verified` | The target AX slider is written and read back within tolerance. | Unsupported params fail before writing; post-write mismatch attempts rollback and returns State C `readback_mismatch`. |

HC v2 is currently scoped to the `logic_plugins` tool only. The existing 8-tool surface keeps HC v1 wire shapes so legacy clients do not see a surprise schema change.

## Which operations return the 3-state contract

As of v3.1.0 (envelope) + v3.4.5-rc5 (mixer extras):
- `track.select`
- `track.set_instrument`
- `mixer.set_volume`, `mixer.set_pan`, `mixer.set_master_volume` — plus MCU connection extras
- `transport.set_cycle_range`
- `transport.set_tempo` — State C `readback_unavailable` when fallback execution cannot be verified
- `project.save_as` — State A only after the target `.logicx` package exists and existing-package mtime advances; State C `readback_mismatch` otherwise
- `midi.import_file` — State A only after Logic imports a `/tmp/LogicProMCP/*.mid` file and a new live AX track appears; State C `readback_mismatch` otherwise
- `logic_plugins.get_inventory` — HC v2 State A when the physical insert chain is readable; State B when the AX mixer subtree is unavailable
- `logic_plugins.insert_verified` — HC v2 State A only after exact-slot plugin readback
- `logic_plugins.set_param_verified` — HC v2 State A only after parameter write/readback tolerance check

Router-level (v3.4.5-rc5+):
- Any operation whose channel chain is fully exhausted returns State C `channels_exhausted` instead of a free-form error string.

Planned for future releases:
- HC v2 expansion beyond `logic_plugins.*` after client compatibility review.
- All remaining `track.*`, `mixer.*`, `transport.*` mutating operations that still use legacy text or partial HC shapes.

## State resource (query)

Read-only resources such as `logic://tracks` and `logic://library/inventory` use a cache envelope instead of the 3-state contract:

```json
{"cache_age_sec": 12, "fetched_at": "2026-04-24T13:00:00Z", "data": [...]}
```

- `cache_age_sec`: Cache age in seconds. `0` means just refreshed.
- The client can request a refresh via the `refresh` flag if needed.

## Recommended client pattern

```pseudo
result = call("track.set_instrument", {...})

if not result.success:
    # State C: hard fail, try alternate path
    abort_or_fallback(result.error)

elif result.verified:
    # State A: confirmed, proceed
    next_step()

else:
    # State B: uncertain
    if result.reason == "echo_timeout_500ms":
        sleep(0.5)
        actual = query("logic://tracks")
        if actual.matches(result.requested):
            proceed()
        else:
            retry_or_abort()
    # ... handle other reasons
```

## Developer guide (server side)

When adding a new mutating operation:
1. AX write → check success (State C branch)
2. On write success, attempt read-back
3. Read-back success + value matches → State A
4. Read-back failure or mismatch → State B with explicit `reason`
5. All branches must return the `verified` field
6. Add 3-state test cases to `Tests/HonestContractTests.swift`

Violations:
- ❌ `return {"success": true}` — missing `verified`
- ❌ `return {"verified": false}` — missing `reason`
- ❌ `return {"success": false}` — missing `error`
- ❌ No read-back code at all + `verified:true`

## Related release notes

- **v3.1.0** — Initial Honest Contract introduced. T2–T8 tickets completed.
- **v3.1.0 Ralph-2 fix** — MCU `pollFaderEcho` stale-cache false-positive blocked (send-time freshness stamp introduced); `track.select` mismatch reclassified as `readback_mismatch` (previously `retry_exhausted`); `scan_library {mode:both}` also updates `lastPanelScan`; `track.set_instrument` / `transport.set_cycle_range` State C `.error(...)` wrapping unified; resource envelope (`{cache_age_sec, fetched_at, data}` / `{source, root}`) correctly declared as a breaking change in CHANGELOG.
- **v3.6.0** — `logic_plugins.*` introduces HC v2 for verified plugin apply-back: physical insert inventory, exact-slot stock plugin insertion, and Compressor threshold write/readback.
