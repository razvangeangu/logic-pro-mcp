/// T-A1 (#10) — opt-in raw-MIDI trace for the MCU bidirectional port.
///
/// thomas-doesburg confirmed (registration/bank/timeout all excluded) that
/// Logic Pro 12.2 returns no fader pitch-bend / V-Pot echo after a *host*
/// write, leaving `set_volume`/`set_pan` permanently at State B
/// `echo_timeout`. The connection-snapshot triplet shows the connection is
/// healthy; what it cannot show is whether Logic emits *any* inbound frame at
/// all after a write. `MCU_TRACE=1` dumps every TX/RX MIDI frame so the raw
/// byte stream can confirm the regression definitively.
///
/// Design notes:
/// - Writes straight to **stderr** (or an injected handle). stdout is reserved
///   for the JSON-RPC stream and must stay byte-clean.
/// - Bypasses `Log`'s rate limiter on purpose: at the 25ms echo-poll cadence a
///   collapsed trace is useless, so frames go directly to the handle.
/// - RX frames are traced *before* `MIDIFeedback.parseBytes`, so frames that do
///   not decode into a known event are still visible (the whole point — proving
///   "nothing came back", not "nothing we recognised came back").
